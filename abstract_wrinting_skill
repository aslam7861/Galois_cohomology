\textbf{Abstract:} Local fundamental class of cohomology group has many applications in algebraic number theory. Debeerst has presented an algorithm in his thesis and applied it but he managed only to compute the local fundamental class for field extension as high as of degree 40. There was some problem stated by him and there were some other problems, which we discuss in this because of that the algorithm was very slow. In this, some algorithms  will  be  presented to solve the problem which he stated. We also present some different approach which will be very effective to follow the steps of the algorithm. One can apply it using all the information provided in this to compute the fundamental class successfully for higher degree field extension. As an application of local fundamental class we present an algorithm to compute the Galois group of Eisenstein polynomial of higher degree whose Ramification polygon has two segments.

\section{Introduction}
Let $K$ be a $p$-adic local field with characteristic $0$ and denote $\overline{K}/K$ as a separable closure of $K$. Suppose $L/K$ be the sub-extension of $\overline{K}/K$ and $v_{K}$ denotes the discrete valuation of $K$, which we always think of normalized so that its smallest positive value is $1$. For field $K$, the ring of integers is denoted by $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ and  the unique maximal ideal by $\mathfrak{p}_K$ in it. Suppose $L/K$ be the Galois local field extension with Galois group $G=\Gal(L/K)$ then the multiplicative group $L^{\times}$ forms the class formations. The second cohomology group for the extension $L/K$ is  $H^2(G,L^{\times})$. The element 
$\gamma \in H^2(G,L^{\times})$ is a map 
\[\gamma : G \times G \rightarrow L^{\times} \mbox{defined as......}\]
Let $\inv :H^2(G,L^{\times}) \rightarrow \frac{1}{[L:K]}\frac{\mathbb{Z}}{\mathbb{Z}} $ be the invariant map which is an isomorphism. The element $u \in H^2(G,L^{\times})$ is said to be the local fundamental class if $inv(u)= \frac{1}{[L:K]}+\mathbb{Z}$.\\
In this, we are mainly interested to compute the cohomology group and the fundamental class. The Galois module $L^{\times}$ is not finitely presented, so it is difficult to derive the cohomology group $H^2(G,L^{\times})$. We first find the finitely generated $G$-modulle $M$ for which we have  $ H^{2}(G,M) \cong H^{2}(G,L^{\times})$. \\
In the previous research, one of the major problem for computing the fundamental class was the norm equation. We have discussed and presented algorithms in the previous chapter which solve the norm equation. Using tgose algorithms, one can successfully compute the norm equations for higher field extensions. \\
Let $E/L$ be the unramified extension, $N: E\rightarrow L$ be the norm map and an element $c\in E$ such that the norm $N(c)=1$. The Galois group $G=G(E/L)=<\varphi>$ is cyclic, where $\varphi$ is the Frobenius automorphism. We present an algorithm to solve the equation of type $x^{\varphi-1}=c$ which is much faster than the approach provided in the previous research.\\
Let $f\in \mathbb{Q}_{p}[x]$ be an Eisenstein polynomial of degree $n$ with a root $\alpha$. The ramification polygon of $f$ denoted by, $R_f$, is defined as 
\[ R_f = f(\alpha +x)/\alpha^n*x. \]
The ramification polygon of $f$ is the Newton polygon of $R_f$.
The main interest to study the local fundamental class was to apply that for the computation of the Galois group of Eisenstein polynomial $f$ whose ramification polygon has two segments.  It was only possible to compute the Galois group for such polynomials of less degree in $\mathbb{Q}_p[x]$ with small prime $p$, in the previous works done by others.  In this, we present the algorithm to compute the Galois group of high degree polynomials and present ideas for many steps of it to apply effectively. At the end, there is a computation table of Galois group for few polynomials of higher degree.
